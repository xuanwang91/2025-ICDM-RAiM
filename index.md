# RAiM 2025: The First International Workshop on Resilient Artificial Intelligence for Manufacturing (IEEE ICDM 2025)

Time: **Nov 11-15, 2025**

Location: **Washington D.C., USA**


## Introduction
With the advent of the Industrial Internet and pervasive computing technologies, manufacturing has entered an era of data-driven decision-making, enabling enhanced production efficiency, product quality, flexibility, and cost optimization. The confluence of AI and manufacturing is of paramount significance nowadays. While prior workshops have touched on manufacturing AI and AI model uncertainties, none have comprehensively addressed the implications of AI resilience within the context of online computation services based on Manufacturing Industrial Internet. An envisioned resilient AI system in manufacturing does not exist today, which is expected to automatically self-heal the AI performance in a timely manner, under various hazardous factors, such as data quality deterioration, AI algorithm singularity, communication and computation node failure, etc. The objective of this one-day RAiM 2025 workshop is to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can be resiliently trained and deployed in manufacturing operation tasks, e.g., product design automation, quality and reliability assurance, production control and process control, and human-machine collaborations.

## Scope of Topics
We invite submissions of original research papers that address, but are not limited to, the following areas:

- Reliability/resilience of manufacturing AI models
- AI model robustness and uncertainty quantification
- Manufacturing data quality and data sharing
- Monitoring, diagnosis, and mitigation strategies for manufacturing AI resilience
- Foundation AI models in manufacturing
- Human-in-the-loop AI systems in manufacturing
- Development of benchmark datasets and open-source AI tools for manufacturing AI modeling

## Submission Format Requirements
-	Paper length: up to 8 pages of content + up to 2 extra pages for references/appendices (maximum 10 pages total).
-	Template: following the ICDM 2025 guideline
-	Review: Papers will be peer-reviewed and selected for invited or poster presentations.
-	Originality: Submissions must be original and not under consideration elsewhere. Duplicate submissions to multiple ICDM workshops are prohibited.
-	Proceedings: Accepted papers will appear in the IEEE ICDM 2025 Workshop Proceedings (ICDMW) and in IEEE Xplore. At least one author must register for the full conference and present the paper in person.

## Important Dates 
-	Paper Submission Deadline: 29 August 2025
-	Author Notification: 15 September 2025
-	Camera‑Ready & Copyright: 25 September 2025
-	Workshop Date: 12 November 2025 (tentative, Day 1 of ICDM)

## How to Submit
Submit your manuscript as a PDF through the ICDM 2025 Workshop CyberChair portal (link to be announced on the workshop website). Select “RAiM 2025 Workshop” when choosing the submission track.

## Attendance & Registration Policy
At least one organizer and one author per accepted paper must attend ICDM 2025 in person with full registration. Authors who need a U.S. visa should begin the application process early. ICDM does not provide online streaming due to venue constraints.

## Workshop Format
The half‑day program will feature:
- 2 keynotes by leading academics/industry experts
- Peer‑reviewed paper presentations (oral & poster)
- A panel discussion on open challenges and future directions

## Program Co-Chairs
- Ran Jin, Virginia Tech
- Ismini Lourentzou, University of Illinois Urbana‑Champaign
- Xuan Wang, Virginia Tech
- Yingyan Zeng, University of Cincinnati

Join us in shaping the future of resilient AI for manufacturing by contributing your latest research to RAiM 2025. We look forward to receiving your submissions and to an engaging, in‑person workshop at IEEE ICDM 2025.
For any questions about scope, submissions, or logistics, please reach out to the Workshop Co-Chairs, Dr. Ran Jin, Dr. Ismini Lourentzou, and Dr. Xuan Wang at TBD.
